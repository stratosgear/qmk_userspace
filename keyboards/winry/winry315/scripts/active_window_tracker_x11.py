"""python-xlib example which reacts to changing the active window/title.

Requires:
- Python
- python-xlib

Tested with Python 2.x because my Kubuntu 14.04 doesn't come with python-xlib
for Python 3.x.

Design:
-------

Any modern window manager that isn't horrendously broken maintains an X11
property on the root window named _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW.

Any modern application toolkit presents the window title via a property
named _NET_WM_NAME.

This listens for changes to both of them and then hides duplicate events
so it only reacts to title changes once.

Known Bugs:
-----------

- Under some circumstances, I observed that the first window creation and last
  window deletion on on an empty desktop (ie. not even a taskbar/panel) would
  go ignored when using this test setup:

      Xephyr :3 &
      DISPLAY=:3 openbox &
      DISPLAY=:3 python3 x11_watch_active_window.py

      # ...and then launch one or more of these in other terminals
      DISPLAY=:3 leafpad
